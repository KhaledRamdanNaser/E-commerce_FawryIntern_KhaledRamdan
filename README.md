# 🛍️ E-Commerce Cart System – Fawry Internship Task

This is a Java console-based e-commerce cart simulation developed for the **Fawry Quantum Rise Internship Challenge (Task 3)**.

## ✅ Features
- Add products (Cheese, TV, Scratch Cards, Snacks) with stock tracking
- Validate expiration dates using `LocalDate`
- Apply flat shipping fee only to shippable items (Cheese, TV)
- Display total shipping weight in shipping notice
- Print receipt with subtotal, shipping, total, and remaining balance
- Designed using clean OOP principles:
  - `Product` as abstract base class
  - `Shippable` interface
  - Inheritance for specific product types

## 💻 Technologies Used
- Java 8+
- Java Time API (`java.time.LocalDate`)
- Console-based input/output
- ## ScreenShots
